## Creating a Trade

There are several ways to create a new trade in EdgeBook:

### Method 1: Click the + Button
Click the **+ New Trade** button in the top navigation bar to open the trade creation modal.

### Method 2: Drag and Drop
Drag a chart screenshot directly onto the trades area. EdgeBook will create a new trade with that image attached.

### Method 3: Paste from Clipboard
Copy a screenshot to your clipboard and press `Ctrl+V` (or `Cmd+V` on Mac) anywhere in the app. A new trade will be created with the pasted image.
