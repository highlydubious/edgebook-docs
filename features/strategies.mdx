## Overview

The Strategies & Setups system helps you organize your trading approach into a clear hierarchy. Define your strategies at the top level, then break them down into specific setups that you trade.

## Understanding the Hierarchy

```
Strategy (e.g., "Momentum Trading")
├── Setup 1 (e.g., "Opening Range Breakout")
├── Setup 2 (e.g., "Gap and Go")
└── Setup 3 (e.g., "VWAP Bounce")
```

### Strategies
High-level trading approaches that define your overall methodology.

**Examples:**
- Momentum Trading
- Mean Reversion
- Trend Following
- Swing Trading
- Options Strategies

### Setups
Specific, repeatable trade scenarios within a strategy.

**Examples:**
- Opening Range Breakout
- Bull Flag Continuation
- Double Bottom Reversal
- VWAP Bounce
- Earnings Breakout

## Adding Setups

Once you have a strategy, add setups to it:

3. Name the setup and describe its criteria
4. Add detailed notes about entry, exit, and management

## Setup Documentation

Each setup should include:

### Entry Criteria
- What conditions must be present?
- What confirms the setup?
- What invalidates it?

### Risk Management
- Where is the stop loss?
- How do you size the position?
- What's the maximum risk?

### Targets
- Where are profit targets?
- How do you trail stops?
- When do you take partial profits?

### Notes
- Edge explanation
- Best market conditions
- Common mistakes to avoid

<Tip>
  Use the rich text editor to create checklists in your setup notes. Check off criteria in real-time during trade evaluation.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple" icon="play">
    Begin with 2-3 strategies and 3-5 setups each. You can always add more as you develop your trading.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be specific" icon="bullseye">
    Vague setups lead to inconsistent trading. Define exact criteria that leave no room for interpretation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and refine" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Regularly review your setups. Remove ones that don't work. Improve ones that do. Add new discoveries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Link every trade" icon="link">
    Always link trades to setups. Trades without a setup assignment often indicate undisciplined trading.
