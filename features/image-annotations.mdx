4. The annotation editor opens with your image

## Annotation Tools

### Lines and Arrows

Draw straight lines and arrows to indicate:
- Trend directions
- Price movements
- Entry and exit points
- Support and resistance levels

**How to use:**
1. Select the line or arrow tool
2. Click and drag to draw
3. Release to complete

### Shapes

Add geometric shapes for highlighting areas:

- **Rectangle** - Box around consolidation zones
- **Ellipse** - Circle key price areas
- **Freehand** - Draw custom shapes

### Text Labels

Add text annotations anywhere on your chart:

1. Select the text tool
2. Click where you want the label
3. Type your text
4. Click outside to finish

Common uses:
- "Entry" / "Exit" labels
- Price levels
- Pattern names
- Notes and observations

### Freehand Drawing

Draw freely on your chart for:
- Custom markings
- Circling areas of interest
- Quick sketches

## Customization

### Colors

The default annotation color is EdgeBook's signature lime green (#a7d400). You can change colors for individual annotations:

1. Select an annotation
2. Click the color picker
3. Choose your color

<Tip>
  Use consistent colors for different types of annotations. For example, green for entries and red for exits.
</Tip>

### Line Width

Adjust the thickness of lines and shapes:
- Thin lines for precise levels
- Thick lines for emphasis

### Text Size

Resize text annotations for visibility:
- Small for detailed labels
- Large for important callouts

## Non-Destructive Editing

EdgeBook preserves your original images:

- Annotations are saved as a separate layer
- You can edit or remove annotations anytime
- The original image quality is never affected

## Saving Annotations

Click **Save** when you're done annotating. The annotated version becomes the displayed image, while the original is preserved for future editing.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep it clean" icon="broom">
    Don't over-annotate. Mark only the most important elements - entry, exit, key levels, and pattern boundaries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent styles" icon="palette">
    Develop a personal system: same colors for same meanings, consistent line widths, standardized label formats.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Annotate after the trade" icon="clock">
    Adding annotations after the trade helps you objectively mark what actually happened, not what you hoped would happen.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Label your timeframes" icon="clock">
    When including multiple timeframe charts, add a text label showing the timeframe (e.g., "Daily", "1H", "5M").
  </Accordion>

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Escape` | Deselect tool |
