## What Gets Shared

When you share a trade, viewers can see:

- **Title** - Your trade's title
- **Date** - When the trade was taken
- **Symbol** - The ticker/instrument
- **Result** - Win, Loss, Breakeven
- **Rating** - Your quality rating
- **Notes** - Your trade analysis (if included)
- **Tags** - Applied tags
- **Images** - All attached chart screenshots

<Note>
  Shared trades are a **snapshot** at the time of sharing. If you update the trade later, the shared version remains unchanged.
