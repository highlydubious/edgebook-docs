## Overview

Every trade in EdgeBook can have multiple chart screenshots attached. The Chart Gallery provides a powerful way to view, organize, and navigate your trade documentation.

## Adding Images

There are several ways to add chart screenshots to a trade:

### Drag and Drop

Simply drag image files from your desktop or file explorer directly onto:
- The trade detail view
- The trade creation modal
- The main trades area (creates a new trade)

### Paste from Clipboard

1. Copy a screenshot to your clipboard (e.g., from TradingView)
2. Press `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` in the trade detail view
3. The image is automatically added to the gallery

### File Upload

1. Click the **+ Add Image** button
2. Select one or more images from your computer
3. Images are uploaded and attached to the trade

<Tip>
  You can upload multiple images at once by selecting them all in the file picker.
</Tip>

## Gallery View

### Thumbnail Strip

All attached images appear as thumbnails at the bottom of the trade detail view. Click any thumbnail to view it in the main display area.
