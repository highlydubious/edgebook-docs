## Overview

The Pattern Library is your personal collection of recurring chart patterns. Save examples from your trades, add notes, and build a reference playbook that you can review before and during trading sessions.

## Why Build a Pattern Library?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recognition speed" icon="bolt">
    The more examples you collect, the faster you'll recognize patterns in real-time. Visual pattern matching becomes intuitive with practice.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistency" icon="equals">
    A documented library ensures you're trading the same setups consistently, not making impulsive decisions based on vague similarities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and refine" icon="rotate">
    Regularly reviewing your patterns helps you refine your edge and identify which patterns work best for your trading style.

## Creating Patterns

### From Trade Images

The easiest way to create a pattern is from an existing trade:

1. Open a trade with chart images
2. Click the **Add to Pattern Library** button on any image
3. Choose to create a new pattern or add to an existing one
4. Add notes about the pattern

### Manual Creation

Create patterns without linking to trades:

1. Go to the **Patterns** section in the sidebar
2. Click **+ New Pattern**
3. Add a title and description
4. Upload images or add from existing trades

## Pattern Details

Each pattern can include:

### Basic Information
- **Title** - A descriptive name (e.g., "Bull Flag Breakout", "Double Bottom Reversal")
- **Description** - What makes this pattern work

### Images
- Multiple example images
- Before and after comparisons
- Different market conditions

### Notes
- Entry criteria
- Stop loss placement
- Target expectations
- Common variations

### Tags
- Organize by pattern type (breakout, reversal, continuation)
- Market conditions (trend, range, volatile)
- Timeframes (daily, intraday)

## Viewing Patterns

### Grid View
See all patterns as visual cards with thumbnail previews. Great for quick browsing.

### List View
A more compact view with pattern titles and metadata. Good for larger libraries.

### Filtering
Filter your patterns by:
- Tags
- Date created
- Search by title or description

## Using Patterns During Trading

  <Step title="Find matching patterns">
    Browse or search for similar examples in your library.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare criteria">
    Check if the current setup matches your documented criteria.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute with confidence">
    If the pattern matches, execute according to your documented plan.

## Pattern Organization

### Tags for Categorization

Create a tagging system that works for you:

**By Pattern Type:**
- `breakout`
- `pullback`
- `reversal`
- `continuation`

**By Market Condition:**
- `trending`
- `ranging`
- `high-volatility`

**By Timeframe:**
- `daily`
- `4h`
- `1h`
- `scalp`

### Linking to Strategies

Connect patterns to your broader trading strategies:

1. Open a pattern
2. Link it to a strategy/setup
3. When trading that setup, reference the pattern examples

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quality over quantity" icon="gem">
    Don't add every trade to your pattern library. Be selective - only add the clearest, most representative examples.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include failures" icon="circle-xmark">
    Add examples of patterns that failed. Understanding why a pattern didn't work is as valuable as knowing when it works.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Markets evolve. Regularly review your patterns and update or remove ones that no longer apply.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add context" icon="circle-info">
    Include notes about market conditions, news events, or other factors that contributed to the pattern's success or failure.
  </Accordion>
