## Rich Text Editor

EdgeBook uses a modern block-based editor (powered by BlockNote) that makes writing trade notes a pleasure:

### Text Formatting

- **Bold** - `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B`
- *Italic* - `Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ - `Ctrl+Shift+S` / `Cmd+Shift+S`
- `Code` - for ticker symbols or specific values

### Structure

- **Headings** - Organize notes with H1, H2, H3
- **Bullet lists** - Quick points and observations
- **Numbered lists** - Step-by-step analysis
- **Checklists** - Trade review items

<Tip>
  Type `/` to open the block menu and quickly insert different block types.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be consistent" icon="repeat">
    Use templates to maintain the same structure across all trades. This makes it easier to review and identify patterns in your trading.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Write immediately" icon="clock">
    Document your thoughts while the trade is fresh. Waiting too long leads to forgotten details and rationalized hindsight.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include emotions" icon="heart">
    Note your emotional state before, during, and after the trade. Emotional patterns often correlate with trading patterns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review regularly" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Set aside time weekly or monthly to review your journal entries. Look for patterns in your wins and losses.
