## Overview

Workflow Statuses let you track where each trade is in your review process. Create custom statuses that match how you actually work, then filter and organize trades by status.

## Default Statuses

EdgeBook comes with basic statuses, but you can fully customize them:
- To Review
- Reviewed
- Archived

## Managing Statuses

### Accessing Status Management

1. Go to **Manage** in the sidebar
2. Click **Statuses**

### Creating a Status

1. Click **+ Add Status**
2. Enter a name (e.g., "Needs Work", "In Progress")
3. Choose a color
4. Click Save

### Editing a Status

1. Click on a status in the list
2. Modify the name or color
3. Click Save

### Reordering Statuses

Drag and drop statuses to change their order:
- The order affects Kanban Board column arrangement
- First status is often the default for new trades

### Deleting a Status

1. Click the trash icon on a status
2. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Trades with a deleted status will need to be reassigned to another status.
</Warning>

## Status Colors

Choose colors that make sense for your workflow:

| Status Type | Suggested Color |
|-------------|-----------------|
| New/Pending | Blue |
| In Progress | Yellow |
| Needs Work | Red/Orange |
| Reviewed/Done | Green |
| Archived | Gray |

## Example Workflows

### Simple Review

```
To Review → Reviewed → Done
```

### Detailed Analysis

```
Logged → In Review → Analyzed → Lesson Captured → Applied
```

### Team Workflow

```
New → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Approved
```

### Learning Focus

```
Raw → Analyzed → Pattern Found → Backtested → Incorporated
```

## Using Statuses

### On Individual Trades

Set or change status in the trade detail view:
1. Open a trade
2. Click the status dropdown
3. Select a new status

### In Bulk (Kanban Board)

Drag trades between columns to change status instantly.

### For Filtering

Use the Status filter in the sidebar to show only trades with specific statuses.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match your actual process" icon="check">
    Create statuses for steps you actually do. Don't add statuses just because they seem like good ideas.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep it simple" icon="minimize">
    3-5 statuses is usually enough. Too many creates confusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use action words" icon="play">
    "To Review" is clearer than "Review". "In Progress" is better than "Progress".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and refine" icon="arrows-rotate">
    After using your workflow for a while, remove statuses you don't use and add ones you need.
  </Accordion>
