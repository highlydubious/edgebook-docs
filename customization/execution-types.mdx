## Overview

Execution Types help you categorize trades by how they were executed. Separate your real money trades from paper trades and trades you watched but didn't take.

## Default Execution Types

EdgeBook includes three default types:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Real** | Actual money trades | Your real trading activity |
| **Paper** | Simulated trades | Practice and testing |
| **Watched** | Observed but not taken | Trades you tracked but didn't execute |

## Managing Execution Types

### Accessing Execution Type Settings

1. Go to **Manage** in the sidebar
2. Click **Execution Types**

### Creating a Custom Type

1. Click **+ Add Type**
2. Enter a name
3. Choose a color
4. Click Save

### Custom Type Examples

- **Demo Account** - Trades on a demo platform
- **Competition** - Paper trading competition entries
- **Backtest** - Historical trade analysis
- **Mentor Trade** - Trades taken following a mentor's calls

## Using Execution Types

### Setting on a Trade

1. Create or edit a trade
2. Select the execution type from the dropdown
3. Save the trade

### Filtering by Type

Use the Execution Type filter to:
- View only real trades for performance analysis
- Review paper trades separately
- Analyze watched trades for missed opportunities

## Analysis Benefits

### Separating Performance

Keep real and paper trades separate:
- Real trades show actual performance
- Paper trades show theoretical performance
- Compare to see if you execute differently with real money

### Tracking Watched Trades

Log trades you saw but didn't take:
- Review missed opportunities
- Identify patterns you hesitate on
- Build confidence in your setups

### Testing New Strategies

Use paper trades to:
- Test new setups before risking real money
- Track results over time
- Decide when to go live

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Be honest about types" icon="scale-balanced">
    Don't mark paper trades as real. Accurate categorization leads to accurate analysis.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Log watched trades" icon="eye">
    Trades you didn't take are valuable data. They show what you're missing and why.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review by type" icon="chart-bar">
    Periodically analyze each type separately. You might trade differently in paper vs real.
