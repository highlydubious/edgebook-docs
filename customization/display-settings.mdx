## Overview

Display Settings let you control what information appears on trade cards and how the interface is laid out. Customize the view to show exactly what you need.

## Card Display Options

Choose what to show on trade cards in List view:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | Trade name/description |
| **Date** | When the trade was taken |
| **Symbol** | Ticker symbol |
| **Rating** | Star rating |
| **Result** | Win/Loss/Breakeven/Open |
| **Tags** | Applied tags |
| **Status** | Workflow status |
| **Notes preview** | Snippet of notes |
| **Image count** | Number of attached images |

### Toggling Options

1. Click the **Display** settings icon in the toolbar
2. Check or uncheck options
3. Changes apply immediately

## Grid Columns

Adjust how many cards appear per row:

- **2 columns** - Large cards, more detail
- **3 columns** - Balanced view (default)
- **4 columns** - More cards, less detail
- **5+ columns** - Compact overview

### Changing Columns

1. Click the grid column selector
2. Choose your preferred column count
3. The layout adjusts immediately

<Tip>
  Fewer columns work better when you want to see more detail. More columns help you scan many trades quickly.
</Tip>

## View-Specific Settings

- **List View** - Card options + grid columns

When you save a Saved View, display settings are included.
