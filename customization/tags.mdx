## Overview

Tags provide flexible categorization for your trades. Unlike statuses which track workflow, tags describe characteristics of the trade itself - the setup type, market conditions, mistakes made, or any other attribute you want to track.

## Creating Tags

### From the Trade Form

1. Open a trade (new or existing)
2. Click in the Tags field
3. Type a new tag name
4. Press Enter to create it

### From Tag Management

1. Go to **Manage** > **Tags**
2. Click **+ Add Tag**
3. Enter name and choose color
4. Click Save

## Tag Colors

Assign colors to make tags visually distinct:
- Similar tags can share colors (all setup types in blue)
- Warning tags in red/orange
- Positive tags in green

## Tag Ideas

### By Setup Type

- `breakout`
- `pullback`
- `reversal`
- `gap-fill`
- `trend-continuation`

### By Market Condition

- `trending`
- `ranging`
- `volatile`
- `low-volume`
- `news-driven`

### By Session

- `pre-market`
- `open`
- `mid-day`
- `close`
- `after-hours`

### By Mistake/Lesson

- `oversize`
- `early-entry`
- `late-exit`
- `FOMO`
- `revenge-trade`
- `perfect-execution`

### By Instrument Type

- `stock`
- `options`
- `futures`
- `forex`
- `crypto`

## Using Tags

### Applying Multiple Tags

A single trade can have many tags:
- Setup: `breakout`
- Condition: `trending`
- Session: `open`
- Quality: `A+ setup`

### Filtering by Tags

1. Open the filter sidebar
2. Expand the Tags section
3. Select one or more tags
4. Only matching trades appear

### Analyzing by Tags

Use tag filters to answer questions like:
- "How do my breakout trades perform?"
- "Do I trade better in trending vs ranging markets?"
- "What's my win rate on pre-market setups?"

## Managing Tags

### Editing Tags

1. Go to **Manage** > **Tags**
2. Click a tag to edit
3. Change name or color
4. Save

### Merging Tags

If you have duplicate tags (e.g., "breakout" and "Breakout"):
1. Edit all trades with the duplicate tag
2. Replace with the correct tag
3. Delete the duplicate

### Deleting Tags

1. Go to **Manage** > **Tags**
2. Click the trash icon
3. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  Deleting a tag removes it from all trades that had it applied.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be consistent with naming" icon="font">
    Use lowercase, consistent naming: `breakout` not `Breakout` or `BREAKOUT`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't over-tag" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    3-5 tags per trade is usually enough. Too many tags become meaningless.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create a tag taxonomy" icon="sitemap">
    Decide on your tag categories upfront: setups, conditions, mistakes, etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review tag usage" icon="chart-pie">
    Periodically check which tags you actually use and remove unused ones.
  </Accordion>
