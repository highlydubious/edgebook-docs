### Multiple Accounts

Different trading accounts or strategies:
- "Main Account" vs "IRA"
- "Swing Trading" vs "Day Trading"
- "Conservative" vs "Aggressive"

### Learning/Mentorship

Separate your trades from mentor calls:

- "Mentor Alerts"
- "Paper Practice"

### Different Personas

Track different trading styles:
- "Scalper Alex"
- "Swing Alex"
- "Options Alex"
