## Overview

EdgeBook's filtering sidebar lets you slice and dice your trade data with precision. Combine multiple filters to find exactly the trades you're looking for.

## Filter Categories

### Result

Filter by trade outcome:
- **Win** - Profitable trades
- **Loss** - Losing trades
- **Breakeven** - No profit or loss
- **Open** - Currently active trades

### Direction

Filter by position type:
- **Long** - Buy positions
- **Short** - Sell/short positions

### Workflow Status

Filter by your custom statuses:
- Select one or multiple statuses
- Great for finding unreviewed trades

### Execution Type

Filter by how the trade was executed:
- **Real** - Actual money trades
- **Paper** - Simulated trades
- **Watched** - Trades you observed but didn't take

### Tags

Filter by applied tags:
- Multi-select supported
- Find trades with specific characteristics

### Symbols

Filter by ticker symbol:
- Multi-select supported
- Find all trades for a specific instrument

### Setups

Filter by strategy setup:
- Linked to your Strategies
- See performance by setup type

### Traders

Filter by trader (if using multi-trader):
- Useful for teams
- Separate your own trades from others

### Rating

Filter by minimum rating:
- Slider from 1-5 stars
- Find your highest-quality trades

### Date Range

Filter by trade date:
- **Presets**: Today, Yesterday, Last Week, Last Month, Last Quarter, Last Year
- **Custom**: Select specific start and end dates

## Combining Filters

Filters work together with AND logic:

**Example**: Find all winning long trades in AAPL from last month
1. Set Result = Win
2. Set Direction = Long
3. Set Symbol = AAPL
4. Set Date = Last Month

Only trades matching ALL criteria will appear.

## Reordering Filter Sections

Drag filter sections to reorder them:
1. Hover over a section header
2. Drag up or down
3. Release to set new position

<Tip>
  Put your most-used filters at the top for quick access.
</Tip>

## Clearing Filters

- **Clear one filter**: Click the X on that filter
- **Clear all filters**: Click "Clear All" at the top of the sidebar

## Filter Persistence

Filters remain active as you:
- Switch between views (List, Board, Table)
- Open and close trade details
- Navigate within the Trades section

Filters reset when you:
- Navigate to a different section (Patterns, Strategies)
- Refresh the page
- Load a different Saved View
