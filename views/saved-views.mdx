## Tips for Effective Views

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create workflow views" icon="arrow-right">
    Create a view for each step in your review process: "To Review" → "In Progress" → "Done".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
    Names like "Last Week Winners" are clearer than "View 1".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep views focused" icon="bullseye">
    Each view should serve a specific purpose. Don't try to combine too many filters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set a useful default" icon="star">
    Your default view should be what you need most often - usually "Recent" or "To Review".
