## Overview

The Kanban Board view transforms your trade journal into a visual workflow management system. See all your trades organized by status, and drag them between columns as you progress through your review process.

## Accessing the Kanban Board

1. Navigate to the **Trades** section
2. Click the **Board** view toggle in the top navigation
3. Your trades appear organized by workflow status

## How It Works

### Columns

Each column represents a workflow status:
- Columns are automatically created from your custom statuses
- The column order matches your status order in settings
- Each column shows a count of trades

### Cards

Trade cards display:
- Trade title and symbol
- Date and result
- Rating (if set)
- First image thumbnail

### Drag and Drop

Move trades between columns:
1. Click and hold a trade card
2. Drag it to a different column
3. Release to update the status

<Tip>
  The status change is saved automatically when you drop the card.
</Tip>

## Compact Mode

Toggle **Compact Mode** to show more trades per column:
- Smaller card sizes
- Less detail per card
- More trades visible at once

## Workflow Examples

### Trade Review Workflow

```
To Review → In Progress → Needs Work → Reviewed → Done
```

### Simple Workflow

```
New → Reviewed → Archived
```

### Learning Workflow

```
Logged → Analyzed → Lesson Extracted → Applied
```

## Customizing Columns

Columns are based on your workflow statuses. To add, remove, or reorder columns:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Statuses**
2. Add new statuses for new columns
3. Drag to reorder
4. Delete statuses to remove columns

<Note>
  Trades in a deleted status column will still exist but won't appear on the board until reassigned.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limit work in progress" icon="hand">
    Don't let too many trades pile up in "In Progress" columns. Complete reviews before starting new ones.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful statuses" icon="tags">
    Create statuses that match your actual review process. Generic statuses like "Status 1" aren't helpful.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular board reviews" icon="calendar">
    Check your board daily or weekly to keep trades moving through your workflow.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
